CeL-Projects
============

This Git is intended as a code repository for projects relating to the Reader's Digest Content eLibrary

As of 3/24/2014 only the DEV code bases have been added to the project. The idea being that eventually we'll have all of our PROD codes on here as well. 

Please organize projects as Epic/Story Number. If story Numbers are linked then place them w/in the same epic and reference them via a comment in the requisite file. Or create a readme file for reference.
